<p>0.4.0 is released today and it comes with it a new game mode: Drafting.</p>
<h1 id="draft-mode">Draft Mode <a class="heading-anchor" href="#draft-mode" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></h1>
<p>The drafting mode is where instead of a predefined scenario, you slowly build the tribe via a series of choices. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what the choices are.</p>
<p><img src="/static/20220309/0HlSrS.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The first step is to choose your Village. The village determines how you grow your population and also one utility ability that you will have. This choice also comes with a choice between the various biomes and also some starting resources.</p>
<p><img src="/static/20220309/fPqW7r.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The second step is to choose the 2 other biomes. Together with the villager choice, you will end up with 3 different biomes. These biomes determines the resources that are available to you as well as the technology that you can choose in the next step.</p>
<p>For example, Coast will give you access to Fishery while Grassland will provide you access to Farms. As more types of buildings get added, these choices will become more significant.</p>
<p>After choosing all the biomes, you will get to choose 4 set of researches.</p>
<p><img src="/static/20220309/2FbTX0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Researches are split into a few categories, but the 2 that we are choosing here are Food Research and Utility Research. In each choice, you will get one food and one utility. There are minor synergies between each technology and some affect which ambition you can tackle.</p>
<p>For example, attempting Prosperity ambition without strong food research is usually a recipe for failure.</p>
<p><img src="/static/20220309/88QQN3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To finish, the last choice is to pick your starting villagers. These sometimes also come with starting buildings that can help out the early game.</p>
<h1 id="biome-changes">Biome Changes <a class="heading-anchor" href="#biome-changes" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></h1>
<p>Because of the draft mode, biome is also massively changed. There are 2 main changes.</p>
<h2 id="biome-resources">Biome Resources <a class="heading-anchor" href="#biome-resources" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>Before this version, biomes have fixed resources. With this version, the resources found are randomly chosen from what is available. For example, this is what is available in the forest.</p>
<p><img src="/static/20220309/kpTVXp.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In each exploration, 4 will be randomly chosen from them. Some type of villagers will also change what is available.</p>
<h2 id="biome-exploration">Biome Exploration <a class="heading-anchor" href="#biome-exploration" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>In the previous version, Explorer can further explore the Biome. This has been extended in this version. Technology has a chance to be found at the end of each exploration.</p>
<p><img src="/static/20220309/vo0168.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also find location with richer resources.</p>
<p><img src="/static/20220309/4irPvo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for the main changes for this version. There are other changes, mostly balance changes. Do give the draft mode a try, and if the game interest you, do join the discord to discuss =).</p>
<hr>
<p>Additional thoughts:
This is probably one of the biggest changes to the game. Initially I wanted the game to be focused on the different tribes and scenarios.
However, as I play the game more, I find myself using the same strategy a lot.
Because of that, I have to make each tribes more restrictive to make it fun.</p>
<p>Instead of doing that, I realised that it might be better if I just create a new mode; Draft Mode.
This mode allows me to enjoy the game. I will probably make another mode similar to the Ascension in Slay the spire.
That would make the game harder and hence be more challenging but more interesting for veterans&hellip; well, that&rsquo;s just me at this point.</p>
